#Shortly url shortening challenge

This is a website that users can use to shorten any urls.
Enter the url in the input box and then click on the shorten it button to get the shortened version of it.
Then you can copy the shortened url to the clipboard and share it with whoever you want.

In this challenge I have learnt how to make different styling to a website. The challenge was quite challenging owing to distinguished and complex stylings and layout. I have learnt how to make different views for both mobile and desktop users. I have also learnt how to design a vibrant and user friendly website. The challenge allowed me to also learn new tailwind css properties like space-x, flex-col-reverse and to name but some.
